## ‚ùó IMPORTANT:

_NoCrypt stated that Google Colab has completely stopped supporting the operability of A1111, and you can be disconnected from the session at any time..._

<div align="center">

### A little background check on the job...

| _Date_   | _Description of Performance_ |
|----------|------------------------------|
| 14.09.23 | - I can't guarantee this or confirm his words, as I worked for 1 hour and wasn't disconnected. I don't know if it was luck or if it's related to something else üòâ |
| 15.09.23 | - I'm really bummed that it stopped working, unlike yesterday's tryout... sad, of course, but I'm not giving up hope! <br> - Still I think the problem is in the code, so we will wait for action from _NoCrypt_ ;d |
|          | - After spending a couple more hours searching for a solution by trial and error, I may have found the reason.. _**(XL is shit, remember this, no kidding, it's true)**_. For now, use the `BETA version` of my colab, perhaps it will still work. **`Sorry but I didn't translate it into English(`** |

### Code to check for session disconnection:

- _I wasn't too lazy to open access in the colaba, so just copy the code below and run it in the cell. In my case, I did not disconnect from the session... Maybe there are conflicts in the main code, I don't know for sure._

## üëâ Beginnings

#### Most of the idea and code comes from [*NoCrypt*](https://github.com/NoCrypt).
I mostly just cut down what I considered unnecessary and little used, and also made my own system for downloading and so on. | Some extensions were removed, some ***config*** files were changed so that the interface was not too cluttered, some things of course were taken from his colab - for example his script `ColabTimer` - a really useful thing, and all the little things in general.

I don't think there's no point in saying anything else, it's clear what this colab does.

**I think I'll keep doing some updates and stuff like that until I get bored, I guess).**
