## ‚ùó IMPORTANT:

_NoCrypt stated that Google Colab has completely stopped supporting the operability of A1111, and you can be disconnected from the session at any time..._

### A little background check on the job...

| _Date_ | _Description of Performance?_ |
|------------|----------------------------|
| 14.09.23 | - I can't guarantee this or confirm his words, as I worked for 1 hour and wasn't disconnected. I don't know if it was luck or if it's related to something else üòâ |
| 15.09.23 | - I'm really bummed that it stopped working, unlike yesterday's tryout... sad, of course, but I'm not giving up hope! |

</div>
<br>

+ I also made some minor changes to my Colab (rewrote a bit of code - maybe something won't work - you can use it, and it will probably work fine without disconnecting from the session) : <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P89RgBbmnVAqtu0kF9BWo7HdJsWCCNxc"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/BETA%20-%20grey?style=for-the-badge&logo=google%20colab&logoColor=orange&label=Colab&labelColor=darkcayan&color=16acc9"></a> <-- not translated into English!

## üëâ Beginnings

#### Most of the idea and code comes from [*NoCrypt*](https://github.com/NoCrypt).
I mostly just cut down what I considered unnecessary and little used, and also made my own system for downloading and so on. | Some extensions were removed, some ***config*** files were changed so that the interface was not too cluttered, some things of course were taken from his colab - for example his script `ColabTimer` - a really useful thing, and all the little things in general.

I don't think there's no point in saying anything else, it's clear what this colab does.

**I think I'll keep doing some updates and stuff like that until I get bored, I guess).**
