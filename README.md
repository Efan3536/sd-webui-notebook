#### Most of the idea and code comes from *NoCrypt*.
I mostly just cut down what I considered unnecessary and little used, and also made my own system for downloading and so on. | Some extensions were removed, some ***config*** files were changed so that the interface was not too cluttered, some things of course were taken from his colab - for example his script `ColabTimer` - a really useful thing, and all the little things in general.

**And although originally everything was made for me. I decided to share what I have already managed to do in the meantime.**
