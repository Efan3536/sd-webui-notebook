## üëâ Beginnings

#### Most of the idea and code comes from *NoCrypt*.
I mostly just cut down what I considered unnecessary and little used, and also made my own system for downloading and so on. | Some extensions were removed, some ***config*** files were changed so that the interface was not too cluttered, some things of course were taken from his colab - for example his script `ColabTimer` - a really useful thing, and all the little things in general.

I don't think there's no point in saying anything else, it's clear what this colab does.

**I think I'll keep doing some updates and stuff like that until I get bored, I guess).**
